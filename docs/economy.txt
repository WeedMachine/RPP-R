- Crafting -
* To manufacture stuff a player must go to a factory and press the manufacture key, he will see a list of everything he can make with the current resources he has stored.
* Players will be able to view what the required materials for all items are at a factory.

- Selling what he made -
* A player can sell what he has manufactured to shops around the map to fill the stock.
* A player will be able to set any object he owns up for sale, text will appear above the object with the price that players can buy for.
* A player can create his own shop marker on the map for a price, if he doesnt own anything within this marker area the marker will be removed to avoid spam.
